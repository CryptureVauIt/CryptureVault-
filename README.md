# 🧠 CryptureVault

Smart Solana wallet that protects assets and delivers real-time insights by understanding token flows, wallet actions, and market signals.

## 🔑 Key Features

### 🔍 Contract Integrity Scanner
Flags risky contract features like open minting, freeze authority, and unlocked liquidity to prevent exposure to malicious tokens.

### 🧪 Vault Risk Index
Calculates token trustworthiness using a composite score based on blacklist presence, ownership changes, and contract vulnerabilities.

### 🐋 Dominance Pattern Monitor
Identifies concentrated wallet holdings to uncover potential manipulation and whale-triggered volatility.

### 🎭 Risk Persona Engine
Transforms complex risk metrics into clear, actionable alerts: **Stable**, **Caution**, or **Critical**, enabling fast user decisions.

### 🗂 Behavioral Memory Sync
Maintains historical token behavior logs to refine future alerts and detect evolving risk patterns with higher precision.

## 🧠 AI Core Functions

### 🔍 Contract Integrity Scanner
Dissects structural logic and flags latent threats.

```python
def scan_contract(token):
    warnings = []
    if token.get("mint_authority") == "open":
        warnings.append("Mint Authority: OPEN")
    if token.get("freeze_authority") == "active":
        warnings.append("Freeze Enabled")
    if not token.get("liquidity_locked", True):
        warnings.append("Liquidity: UNLOCKED")
    return warnings
```
#### AI Insight: Learns from rugged contracts and evolving scam types — fine-tuned to today’s risk vectors.

### 🧪 Vault Risk Index
#### Assigns a trust score based on threat clusters.

```python
def vault_score(token):
    score = 100
    if token.get("blacklist"): score -= 45
    if token.get("mint_authority") == "open": score -= 30
    if not token.get("liquidity_locked", True): score -= 20
    if token.get("owner_changed_recently"): score -= 10
    return max(0, score)
```
#### AI Insight: Mirrors past failure patterns and adapts based on verified breach archives.

### 🐋 Dominance Pattern Monitor
#### Detects wallet concentration and centralized influence.

```js
function dominanceMap(holders) {
  const heavy = holders.filter(h => h.balance >= 0.05);
  return heavy.length >= 5 ? '⚠️ Cluster Detected' : '✅ Balanced Ownership';
}
```
#### AI Insight: Scans for inequality of power — an early sign of rug mechanics.

### 🎭 Risk Persona Engine
#### Translates raw numbers into intuitive alerts.

```js
function tagRiskLevel(score) {
  if (score >= 80) return "🟢 Stable";
  if (score >= 50) return "🟡 Caution";
  return "🔴 Critical";
}
```
#### AI Insight: Converts tech jargon into clean, emotional signals for everyday users.

### 🗂 Behavioral Memory Sync
#### Builds a timeline of token events and pattern shifts.

```python
from datetime import datetime

def track_event(token_id, tag, score):
    record = {
        "token": token_id,
        "event": tag,
        "score": score,
        "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat()
    }
    vault_db[token_id] = {**vault_db.get(token_id, {}), **record}
```
#### AI Insight: Uses token behavior over time to adjust future warnings and sharpen reaction accuracy.
